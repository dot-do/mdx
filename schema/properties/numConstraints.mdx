  Indicates the number of constraints property values defined for a particular [[ConstraintNode]] such as [[StatisticalVariable]]. This helps applications understand if they have access to a sufficiently complete description of a [[StatisticalVariable]] or other construct that is defined using properties on template-style nodes.
