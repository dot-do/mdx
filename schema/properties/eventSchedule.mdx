  Associates an [[Event]] with a [[Schedule]]. There are circumstances where it is preferable to share a schedule for a series of
  repeating events rather than data on the individual events themselves. For example, a website or application might prefer to publish a schedule for a weekly
  gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An [[Event]] that
  is associated with a [[Schedule]] using this property should not have [[startDate]] or [[endDate]] properties. These are instead defined within the associated
  [[Schedule]], this avoids any ambiguity for clients using the data. The property might have repeated values to specify different schedules, e.g. for different months
  or seasons.
