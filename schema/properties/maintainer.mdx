rdfs:comment: "A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always  possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.\n      "
