  Describes the amount that can be redeemed from this incentive.
  
  <p>[[QuantitativeValue]]: Use this for incentives based on price (either raw amount or percentage-based). For a raw amount example, "You can claim $2,500 - $7,500 from the total cost of installation" would be represented as the following:</p>
  {
  "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
  “minValue”: 2500,
  “maxValue”: 7500,
  "unitCode": "USD"
  }
  <p>[[QuantitivateValue]] can also be used for percentage amounts. In such cases, value is used to represent the incentive’s percentage, while maxValue represents a limit (if one exists) to that incentive. The unitCode should be 'P1' and the unitText should be '%', while valueReference should be used for holding the currency type. For example, "You can claim up to 30% of the total cost of installation, up to a maximum of $7,500" would be:</p>
  {
  "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
  "value": 30,
  "unitCode": "P1",
  "unitText": "%",
  “maxValue”: 7500,
  “valueReference”: “USD”
  }
  <p>[[UnitPriceSpecification]]: Use this for incentives that are based on amounts rather than price. For example, a net metering rebate that pays $10/kWh, up to $1,000:</p>
  {
  "@type": "UnitPriceSpecification",
  "price": 10,
  "priceCurrency": "USD",
  "referenceQuantity": 1,
  "unitCode": "DO3",
  "unitText": "kw/h",
  "maxPrice": 1000,
  "description": "$10 / kwh up to $1000"
  }
  <p>[[LoanOrCredit]]: Use for incentives that are loan based. For example, a loan of $4,000 - $50,000 with a repayment term of 10 years, interest free would look like:</p>
  {
  "@type": "LoanOrCredit",
  "loanTerm": {
  "@type":"QuantitativeValue",
  "value":"10",
  "unitCode": "ANN"
  },
  "amount":[
  {
  "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
  "Name":"fixed interest rate",
  "value":"0",
  },
  ],
  "amount":[
  {
  "@type": "MonetaryAmount",
  "Name":"min loan amount",
  "value":"4000",
  "currency":"CAD"
  },
  {
  "@type": "MonetaryAmount",
  "Name":"max loan amount",
  "value":"50000",
  "currency":"CAD"
  }
  ],
  }
  
  In summary: <ul><li>Use [[QuantitativeValue]] for absolute/percentage-based incentives applied on the price of a good/service.</li>
  <li>Use [[UnitPriceSpecification]] for incentives based on a per-unit basis (e.g. net metering).</li>
  <li>Use [[LoanOrCredit]] for loans/credits.</li>
  </ul>.
