rdfs:comment: "Describes the amount that can be redeemed from this incentive.\n    \n<p>[[QuantitativeValue]]: Use this for incentives based on price (either raw amount or percentage-based). For a raw amount example, \"You can claim $2,500 - $7,500 from the total cost of installation\" would be represented as the following:</p>\n    {\n        \"@type\": \"QuantitativeValue\",\n        “minValue”: 2500,\n        “maxValue”: 7500,\n        \"unitCode\": \"USD\"\n    }\n<p>[[QuantitivateValue]] can also be used for percentage amounts. In such cases, value is used to represent the incentive’s percentage, while maxValue represents a limit (if one exists) to that incentive. The unitCode should be 'P1' and the unitText should be '%', while valueReference should be used for holding the currency type. For example, \"You can claim up to 30% of the total cost of installation, up to a maximum of $7,500\" would be:</p>\n    {\n        \"@type\": \"QuantitativeValue\",\n        \"value\": 30,\n        \"unitCode\": \"P1\",\n        \"unitText\": \"%\",\n        “maxValue”: 7500,\n        “valueReference”: “USD”\n    }\n<p>[[UnitPriceSpecification]]: Use this for incentives that are based on amounts rather than price. For example, a net metering rebate that pays $10/kWh, up to $1,000:</p>\n    {\n        \"@type\": \"UnitPriceSpecification\",\n        \"price\": 10,\n        \"priceCurrency\": \"USD\",\n        \"referenceQuantity\": 1,\n        \"unitCode\": \"DO3\",\n        \"unitText\": \"kw/h\",\n        \"maxPrice\": 1000,\n        \"description\": \"$10 / kwh up to $1000\"\n    }\n<p>[[LoanOrCredit]]: Use for incentives that are loan based. For example, a loan of $4,000 - $50,000 with a repayment term of 10 years, interest free would look like:</p>\n    {\n        \"@type\": \"LoanOrCredit\",\n        \"loanTerm\": {\n                \"@type\":\"QuantitativeValue\",\n                \"value\":\"10\",\n                \"unitCode\": \"ANN\"\n            },\n        \"amount\":[\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"QuantitativeValue\",\n                \"Name\":\"fixed interest rate\",\n                \"value\":\"0\",\n            },\n        ],\n        \"amount\":[\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"MonetaryAmount\",\n                \"Name\":\"min loan amount\",\n                \"value\":\"4000\",\n                \"currency\":\"CAD\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"MonetaryAmount\",\n                \"Name\":\"max loan amount\",\n                \"value\":\"50000\",\n                \"currency\":\"CAD\"\n            }\n        ],\n    }\n\nIn summary: <ul><li>Use [[QuantitativeValue]] for absolute/percentage-based incentives applied on the price of a good/service.</li>\n<li>Use [[UnitPriceSpecification]] for incentives based on a per-unit basis (e.g. net metering).</li>\n<li>Use [[LoanOrCredit]] for loans/credits.</li>\n</ul>."
