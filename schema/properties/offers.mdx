  An offer to provide this item&#x2014;for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.
