comment: |
  The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via [[URL]]) a document describing the editorial principles of an [[Organization]] (or individual, e.g. a [[Person]] writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a [[CreativeWork]] (e.g. [[NewsArticle]]) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the [[CreativeWork]].
  
  While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a [[funder]]) can be expressed using schema.org terminology.
