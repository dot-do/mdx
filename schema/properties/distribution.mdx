  A downloadable form of this dataset, at a specific location, in a specific format. This property can be repeated if different variations are available. There is no expectation that different downloadable distributions must contain exactly equivalent information (see also [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Distribution) on this point). Different distributions might include or exclude different subsets of the entire dataset, for example.
