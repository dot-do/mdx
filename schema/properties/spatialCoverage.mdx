  The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of
  contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates
  areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.
