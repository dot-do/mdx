comment: |
  A short string listing or describing pronouns for a person. Typically the person concerned is the best authority as pronouns are a critical part of personal identity and expression. Publishers and consumers of this information are reminded to treat this data responsibly, take country-specific laws related to gender expression into account, and be wary of out-of-date data and drawing unwarranted inferences about the person being described.
  
  In English, formulations such as "they/them", "she/her", and "he/him" are commonly used online and can also be used here. We do not intend to enumerate all possible micro-syntaxes in all languages. More structured and well-defined external values for pronouns can be referenced using the [[StructuredValue]] or [[DefinedTerm]] values.
