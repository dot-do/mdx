  Represents spatial relations in which two geometries (or the places they represent) are topologically equal, as defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM). "Two geometries are topologically equal if their interiors intersect and no part of the interior or boundary of one geometry intersects the exterior of the other" (a symmetric relationship).
