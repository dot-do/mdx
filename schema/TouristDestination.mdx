  A tourist destination. In principle any [[Place]] can be a [[TouristDestination]] from a [[City]], Region or [[Country]] to an [[AmusementPark]] or [[Hotel]]. This Type can be used on its own to describe a general [[TouristDestination]], or be used as an [[additionalType]] to add tourist relevant properties to any other [[Place]].  A [[TouristDestination]] is defined as a [[Place]] that contains, or is colocated with, one or more [[TouristAttraction]]s, often linked by a similar theme or interest to a particular [[touristType]]. The [UNWTO](http://www2.unwto.org/) defines Destination (main destination of a tourism trip) as the place visited that is central to the decision to take the trip.
