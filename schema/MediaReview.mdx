  A [[MediaReview]] is a more specialized form of Review dedicated to the evaluation of media content online, typically in the context of fact-checking and misinformation.
      For more general reviews of media in the broader sense, use [[UserReview]], [[CriticReview]] or other [[Review]] types. This definition is
      a work in progress. While the [[MediaManipulationRatingEnumeration]] list reflects significant community review amongst fact-checkers and others working
      to combat misinformation, the specific structures for representing media objects, their versions and publication context, are still evolving. Similarly, best practices for the relationship between [[MediaReview]] and [[ClaimReview]] markup have not yet been finalized.
