  The LearningResource type can be used to indicate [[CreativeWork]]s (whether physical or digital) that have a particular and explicit orientation towards learning, education, skill acquisition, and other educational purposes.
  
  [[LearningResource]] is expected to be used as an addition to a primary type such as [[Book]], [[VideoObject]], [[Product]] etc.
  
  [[EducationEvent]] serves a similar purpose for event-like things (e.g. a [[Trip]]). A [[LearningResource]] may be created as a result of an [[EducationEvent]], for example by recording one.
