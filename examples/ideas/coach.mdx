# AI Personal Coach

The Personal Coach is an AI agent designed to help users achieve their personal and professional goals through consistent guidance, motivation, and accountability. It adapts to individual learning styles and progress patterns.

## Core Features

- Helps users set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals
- Creates personalized development plans with actionable steps
- Provides regular check-ins and progress assessments
- Offers motivational support and positive reinforcement
- Adapts coaching strategies based on user feedback and progress

## Implementation Approaches

Personal coach agents work best with a combination of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and personalization mechanisms that track user history and preferences over time. They require strong natural language understanding to interpret user goals and provide relevant feedback.
