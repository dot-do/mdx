# AI Research Assistant

The Research Assistant is an AI agent focused on comprehensive information gathering, analysis, and synthesis. It can navigate academic databases, scientific literature, and open data sources to compile relevant information on a given topic.

## Core Features

- Conducts deep literature reviews across multiple databases and sources
- Extracts key information from papers, reports, and datasets
- Synthesizes findings into coherent summaries with proper citations
- Identifies knowledge gaps and suggests areas for further research
- Maintains citation standards and bibliography management

## Implementation Approaches

Research assistants can be implemented with LLM contexts optimized for information retrieval and cross-reference capabilities. They benefit from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and specialized knowledge in scientific or academic domains.
