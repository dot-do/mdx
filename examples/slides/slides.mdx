# Slides Demo

This page demonstrates both embedded and full-screen slide modes.

## Embedded Slides

Here's a presentation embedded within the page content:

<Slides embedded>
  <Slide># Welcome This is an embedded presentation</Slide>
  <Slide># Features - Embedded within page content - Maintains page layout - Perfect for hero sections</Slide>
  <Slide># Navigation - Use arrow keys to navigate - Or click the controls - ESC for overview</Slide>
</Slides>

## More Content

You can have regular content before and after embedded slides.

<Alert type='info'>The embedded presentation above is contained within the normal page layout, just like on the reveal.js website.</Alert>

## Full-Screen Mode

For a full-screen presentation experience, visit [/slides-fullscreen](/slides-fullscreen) which uses:

```mdx
<Slides>
  <Slide>Full screen content</Slide>
</Slides>
```

Without the `embedded` prop, slides take over the entire viewport.
