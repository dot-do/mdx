```

## Using MDXE Components

MDXE includes built-in components and supports mdxui components via mdx-components.js:

### Built-in Components (No setup required)

## Deploying to Vercel

When deploying to Vercel, you can optionally create a `vercel.json` configuration file in your project root to ensure proper handling of the build directory:

```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next",
      "config": {
        "distDir": ".next"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration explicitly tells Vercel to use the `.next` directory in your project root for the build output. Note that with the latest version of mdxe, this configuration is optional as the tool now automatically detects Vercel deployment environments and handles the build directory appropriately.
