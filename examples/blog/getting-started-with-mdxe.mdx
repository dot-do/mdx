# Getting Started with MDXE

Welcome to MDXE! This post will guide you through the basics of building content sites with zero configuration.

## What is MDXE?

MDXE is a zero-config tool for building content sites with Markdown and MDX. It combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components.

## Key Features

- **Zero Configuration**: Just write Markdown and MDX files
- **React Components**: Use any React component in your content
- **Hot Reload**: See changes instantly during development
- **Built-in Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Typography plugin included
- **Component Library**: Access to mdxui components out of the box

## Quick Start

1. Create a new directory for your project
2. Add some `.md` or `.mdx` files
3. Run `mdxe dev` to start the development server
4. That's it! Your site is ready

## Using Components

You can use React components directly in your MDX files:

```mdx
import { Button, Card } from 'mdxui'

<Card title='Welcome'>
  <p>This is a card component!</p>
  <Button>Click me</Button>
</Card>
```
