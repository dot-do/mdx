# Proposed New Examples

The existing `examples/minimal` and `examples/startups` folders demonstrate very basic usage of the MDX tools. After reviewing the research notes, here are ten ideas for additional example projects that could showcase the concepts in the research documents.

1. **Agentic CLI Example** (`examples/agentic-cli`)

   - Based on ideas from `research/agentic-cli.md`.
   - Demonstrates an AI-powered command line that can run shell commands, manage git operations, and respond to user prompts.

2. **Markdown CLI Processor** (`examples/markdown-cli`)

   - Implements the design outlined in `research/markdown-cli.md`.
   - Provides recursive Markdown processing with frontmatter filters and safe git-aware modifications.

3. **Markdown Project Management** (`examples/markdown-project-mgmt`)

   - Uses the workflow described in `research/markdown-project-mgmt.md`.
   - Shows how to track tasks and plans entirely in Markdown within a git repo.

4. **GTD Agents Workflow** (`examples/gtd-agents`)

   - Adapts concepts from `research/gtd-agents.md`.
   - Illustrates an automated “Getting Things Done” pipeline using AI agents and event triggers.

5. **Ink MDX Terminal App** (`examples/ink-mdx`)

   - Implements the MDX renderer for Ink discussed in `research/ink-mdx.md` and `terminal-app-from-mdx.md`.
   - Lets users run interactive MDX content directly in the terminal.

6. **Next.js Notebook** (`examples/next-notebook`)

   - Builds on `research/next-notebook.md` to create a simple MDX-based notebook using Next.js and a browser code sandbox.

7. **Slide Deck Generator** (`examples/presentations`)

   - Inspired by `research/presentations.md`.
   - Shows how to write slides in Markdown/MDX and render them with frameworks like Reveal.js.

8. **Velite Executable Markdown** (`examples/velite-executable`)

   - Follows `research/velite-executable.md` to execute `ts` or `js` code blocks from Markdown files.

9. **NLP Coaching Agents** (`examples/nlp-agents`)

   - Demonstrates the Tony Robbins–style NLP techniques from `research/nlp-agents.md` to create motivational or coaching agents.

10. **Copy–Transform–Combine Ideation** (`examples/ctc-ideation`)
    - Uses ideas from `research/copy-transform-combine.md` and `launch-experiments.md`.
    - Automates startup ideation and experimentation through AI-driven CTC loops.

These examples could reuse the minimal setup for configuration and build scripts, extending it with the features explored in each research document.
