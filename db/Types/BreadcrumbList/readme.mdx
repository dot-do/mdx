  A BreadcrumbList is an ItemList consisting of a chain of linked Web pages,
  typically described using at least their URL and their name, and typically
  ending with the current page.


  The [[position]] property is used to reconstruct the order of the items in a
  BreadcrumbList. The convention is that a breadcrumb list has an
  [[itemListOrder]] of [[ItemListOrderAscending]] (lower values listed first),
  and that the first items in this list correspond to the "top" or beginning of
  the breadcrumb trail, e.g. with a site or section homepage. The specific
  values of 'position' are not assigned meaning for a BreadcrumbList, but they
  should be integers, e.g. beginning with '1' for the first item in the list.
