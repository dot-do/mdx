  An EndorsementRating is a rating that expresses some level of endorsement, for
  example inclusion in a "critic's pick" blog, a

  "Like" or "+1" on a social network. It can be considered the [[result]] of an
  [[EndorseAction]] in which the [[object]] of the action is rated positively by

  some [[agent]]. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more
  useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing
  the [[Action]].


  An [[EndorsementRating]] may be part of a numeric scale or organized system,
  but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,

  endorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as
  it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.

some [[agent]]. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the [[Action]].
