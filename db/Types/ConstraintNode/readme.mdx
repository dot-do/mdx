  The ConstraintNode type is provided to support usecases in which a node in a
  structured data graph is described with properties which appear to describe a
  single entity, but are being used in a situation where they serve a more
  abstract purpose. A [[ConstraintNode]] can be described using
  [[constraintProperty]] and [[numConstraints]]. These constraint properties can
  serve a

  variety of purposes, and their values may sometimes be understood to indicate
  sets of possible values rather than single, exact and specific values.
