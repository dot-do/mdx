  An observational study is a type of medical study that attempts to infer the
  possible effect of a treatment through observation of a cohort of subjects
  over a period of time. In an observational study, the assignment of subjects
  into treatment groups versus control groups is outside the control of the
  investigator. This is in contrast with controlled studies, such as the
  randomized controlled trials represented by MedicalTrial, where each subject
  is randomly assigned to a treatment group or a control group before the start
  of the treatment.
