  Archiving [RFC 5005](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005), for example (and as
  defined for Atom), when using data from a feed that represents a collection of
  items that varies over time (e.g. "Top Twenty Records") there is no need to
  have newer entries mixed in alongside older, obsolete entries. By marking this
  feed as a CompleteDataFeed, old entries can be safely discarded when the feed
  is refreshed, since we can assume the feed has provided descriptions for all
  current items.
