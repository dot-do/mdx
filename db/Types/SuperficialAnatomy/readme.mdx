  anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other
  medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified
  through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial
  anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of
  incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an
  underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by
  palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the
  humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size,
  prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue
  support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the
  glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid
  muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the
  scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the
  visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint
  (the related anatomical structure).

## Description

Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures.

For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision.
