  [[WebPageElement]] content. It is sometimes the case that detailed
  distinctions between Web pages, sites and their parts are not always important
  or obvious. The  [[WebContent]] type makes it easier to describe
  Web-addressable content without requiring such distinctions to always be
  stated. (The intent is that the existing types [[WebPage]], [[WebSite]] and
  [[WebPageElement]] will eventually be declared as subtypes of [[WebContent]].)
