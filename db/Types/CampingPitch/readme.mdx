  A [[CampingPitch]] is an individual place for overnight stay in the outdoors,
  typically being part of a larger camping site, or [[Campground]].



  In British English a campsite, or campground, is an area, usually divided into
  a number of pitches, where people can camp overnight using tents or camper
  vans or caravans; this British English use of the word is synonymous with the
  American English expression campground. In American English the term campsite
  generally means an area where an individual, family, group, or military unit
  can pitch a tent or park a camper; a campground may contain many campsites.
