  A camping site, campsite, or [[Campground]] is a place used for overnight stay
  in the outdoors, typically containing individual [[CampingPitch]] locations.



  In British English a campsite is an area, usually divided into a number of
  pitches, where people can camp overnight using tents or camper vans or
  caravans; this British English use of the word is synonymous with the American
  English expression campground. In American English the term campsite generally
  means an area where an individual, family, group, or military unit can pitch a
  tent or park a camper; a campground may contain many campsites (source:
  Wikipedia, see
