  A [[CriticReview]] is a more specialized form of Review written or published
  by a source that is recognized for its reviewing activities. These can include
  online columns, travel and food guides, TV and radio shows, blogs and other
  independent Web sites. [[CriticReview]]s are typically more in-depth and
  professionally written. For simpler, casually written
  user/visitor/viewer/customer reviews, it is more appropriate to use the
  [[UserReview]] type. Review aggregator sites such as Metacritic already
  separate out the site's user reviews from selected critic reviews that
  originate from third-party sources.
