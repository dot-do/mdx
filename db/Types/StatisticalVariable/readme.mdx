  [[StatisticalVariable]] represents any type of statistical metric that can be
  measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]] is
  typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]],
  which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]]
  is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed
  using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the
  statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place
  or thing. For example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female
  representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the
  population type is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the
  [[statType]] [[median]]; the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note
  that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not
  fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with
  solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow
  partial, incremental or minimal description of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and
  the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external
  repositories. The [[measurementMethod]], [[unitCode]] and [[unitText]]
  properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and notation of an
  observed measurement.

# StatisticalVariable

**Schema.org Type:** [`StatisticalVariable`](https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable)
**Parent Type:** [[../ConstraintNode|ConstraintNode]]

## Description

[[StatisticalVariable]] represents any type of statistical metric that can be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]] is typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]], which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]] is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the [[statType]] [[median]]; the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external repositories. The [[measurementMethod]], [[unitCode]] and [[unitText]] properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and notation of an observed measurement.
