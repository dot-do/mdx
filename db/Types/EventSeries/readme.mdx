  A series of [[Event]]s. Included events can relate with the series using the
  [[superEvent]] property.


  An EventSeries is a collection of events that share some unifying
  characteristic. For example, "The Olympic Games" is a series, which

  is repeated regularly. The "2012 London Olympics" can be presented both as an
  [[Event]] in the series "Olympic Games", and as an

  [[EventSeries]] that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.


  The nature of the association between the events in an [[EventSeries]] can
  vary, but typical examples could

  include a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series
  of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers.


  EventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers
  to use it in an Event context without

  worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an
  Event. In general an EventSeries

  may seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects
  such as location are fixed, but

  it may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an
  Event.
