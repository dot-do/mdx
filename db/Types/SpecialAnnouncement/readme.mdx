  A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information
  update

  with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an
  information update made by a

  locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare
  providers,  community groups, police,

  local government.


  For work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see [this
  doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).


  The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus
  pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic),
  and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org

  expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback
  emerges from use. In addition to our

  usual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490),
  feedback comments can also be provided in [this
  document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).



  While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related
  information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like
  [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there
  may be overlaps. The intent is to cover

  the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites
  during an emergency situation.


  Several kinds of information can be provided:


  We encourage the provision of "name", "text", "datePosted", "expires" (if
  appropriate), "category" and

  "url" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category"
  where possible, most ideally as a well known

  URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus
  pandemic, this should be
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\_coronavirus\_pandemic" or
  "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910".


  For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an
  inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link,
  provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an
  inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a
  property of that, alongside at least a simple "[[text]]" summary of the page.
  It is

  unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible
  properties simultaneously.


  We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more
  specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]],
  [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you
  can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g.
  Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]] property of the
  [[SpecialAnnouncement]].


  Many [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to
  identifiable local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and
  [[announcementLocation]] to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and
  [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and
  a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire
  region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].


  The [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of
  the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only

  for representing non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a
  [[RadioStation]]). For places, use [[announcementLocation]] and
  [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial
  design encouraged the use of [[about]] for locations too.


  The basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of an
  [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or
  [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed. For publishers
  without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting

  [[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with
  Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed

  with the [[webFeed]] property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline
  [[DataFeed]] object, with [[encodingFormat]] providing

  media type information, e.g. "application/rss+xml" or "application/atom+xml".

## Description

A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update
with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a
locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,
local government.
