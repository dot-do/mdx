  A 3D model represents some kind of 3D content, which may have [[encoding]]s in
  one or more [[MediaObject]]s. Many 3D formats are available (e.g. see

  specific encoding formats can be represented using the [[encodingFormat]]
  property applied to the relevant [[MediaObject]]. For the

  case of a single file published after Zip compression, the convention of

  artistic/animation, gaming, engineering and scientific content can all be
  represented using [[3DModel]].
