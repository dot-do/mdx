## Usage Patterns

### JSON-LD Format

All examples can be used as JSON-LD:

```json
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org.ai/context/ai-context.jsonld",
  "@type": "Agent",
  "@id": "https://example.com/agents/my-agent",
  "role": "assistant",
  "model": "claude-3-opus-20240229"
}
```

### MDXLD Format (YAML-LD)

Or as MDXLD with YAML-LD frontmatter:

```mdx
---
$context: http://schema.org.ai/context/ai-context.jsonld
$type: Agent
$id: https://example.com/agents/my-agent
role: assistant
model: claude-3-opus-20240229
---

# My AI Agent

Description and documentation here.
```

### Integration

Use with knowledge graphs, vector databases, and AI frameworks:

```typescript
import { Agent } from 'schema.org.ai'

const agent: Agent = {
  '@context': 'http://schema.org.ai/context/ai-context.jsonld',
  '@type': 'Agent',
  role: 'assistant',
  capabilities: ['answer-questions', 'generate-code'],
  model: 'claude-3-opus-20240229'
}
```
