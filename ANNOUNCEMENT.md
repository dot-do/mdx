## Twitter/X Thread

**Tweet 1:**
🎉 Literate Testing for mdxe v1.0 is live!

Your MDX documentation can now test itself with executable code blocks and automatic assertions.

Documentation stays accurate automatically because it IS the test suite.

🧵 Here's what you can do:

**Tweet 2:**
Write documentation with testable examples:

```ts assert
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2)

expect(doubled[0]).toBe(2)
expect(doubled[4]).toBe(10)
```

Run: `mdxe test:doc your-file.mdx`

**Tweet 3:**
✅ 15+ assertion methods (toBe, toEqual, toContain, toBeGreaterThan, etc.)
✅ Auto-inject results with --update flag
✅ Run in CLI or browser (Cmd+Shift+T in Monaco editor)
✅ Compatible with Vitest API

**Tweet 4:**
Why literate testing?

• Self-documenting code - Examples always work
• Automatic verification - Docs stay accurate
• Fast feedback - Tests run as you type
• Living documentation - Always up-to-date

**Tweet 5:**
Get started today:

```bash
pnpm add mdxe
mdxe test:doc your-file.mdx
```

## Reddit Post (r/javascript, r/react)

**Title:** [Release] mdxe v1.0 - Literate Testing for MDX Documentation

**Body:**

I'm excited to announce **mdxe v1.0** with a new feature called **Literate Testing** - documentation that tests itself!

## What is Literate Testing?

Turn your MDX documentation into self-verifying tests with executable code blocks and automatic assertions. Your docs stay accurate because they ARE the test suite.

**Example:**

```markdown
## Array Operations

\`\`\`ts assert
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2)

expect(doubled.length).toBe(5)
expect(doubled[0]).toBe(2)
expect(doubled[4]).toBe(10)
\`\`\`
```

Run: `mdxe test:doc your-file.mdx`

**Output:**
```
📊 Document Test Results

📄 your-file.mdx
   Blocks: 1/1 passed (100%)
   Assertions: 3/3 passed (100%)

✅ All tests passed!
```

## Key Features

- **15+ assertion methods** - Vitest-compatible API (toBe, toEqual, toContain, etc.)
- **Auto-inject results** - Add `--update` flag to inject assertion results as comments
- **CLI + Browser** - Run tests via CLI or press Cmd+Shift+T in Monaco editor
- **Living documentation** - Examples that always work

## Why This Matters

Traditional documentation gets outdated quickly. Code examples break. Users copy-paste broken code.

With literate testing:
- Examples are tested automatically
- Documentation stays accurate
- Users get working code
- Teams have confidence in their docs

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add mdxe
```

## Dev.to Post

**Title:** Literate Testing: Documentation That Tests Itself

**Tags:** #markdown #testing #documentation #typescript

**Body:**

I'm excited to share a new feature that makes documentation self-verifying: **Literate Testing** in mdxe v1.0.

## The Problem

We've all seen it:
- Documentation with broken examples
- Code samples that don't actually work
- Outdated API usage
- Users copying broken code

Traditional documentation is separate from tests, so they drift apart over time.

## The Solution: Literate Testing

What if your documentation WAS your test suite?

With literate testing, you write examples in your docs that automatically verify themselves:

```markdown
## Array Operations

\`\`\`ts assert
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2)

expect(doubled.length).toBe(5)
expect(doubled[0]).toBe(2)
expect(doubled[4]).toBe(10)
\`\`\`
```

Run tests:
```bash
mdxe test:doc your-file.mdx
```

Get instant feedback:
```
📊 Document Test Results

📄 your-file.mdx
   Blocks: 1/1 passed (100%)
   Assertions: 3/3 passed (100%)

✅ All tests passed!
```

## Features

### 15+ Assertion Methods

Vitest-compatible API that feels familiar:

```typescript
expect(value).toBe(expected)
expect(value).toEqual(expected)
expect(value).toContain(substring)
expect(value).toBeGreaterThan(number)
expect(value).toBeTruthy()
expect(value).not.toBe(expected)
// ... and more
```

### Auto-Inject Results

Add the `--update` flag to inject assertion results as inline comments:

**Before:**
```typescript
const sum = 10 + 20
expect(sum).toBe(30)
```

**After:**
```typescript
const sum = 10 + 20
expect(sum).toBe(30) // ✅ Expected 30 to be 30
```

### Browser Testing

Run tests directly in Monaco editor:
- Press `Cmd+Shift+T` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+T` (Windows)
- See results in beautiful bottom panel
- Real-time pass/fail indicators

### Living Documentation

Your examples become tests. Your tests become examples. They're always in sync because they're the same thing.

## Real-World Examples

### AI Generation

```ts assert
import { generate } from 'mdxai'

const result = await generate('Write a haiku about coding')
const text = await result.text()

expect(text).toBeDefined()
expect(text.split('\n').length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(3)
```

### Database Operations

```ts assert
import { MdxDbFs } from '@mdxdb/fs'

const db = new MdxDbFs({ packageDir: process.cwd() })
const posts = db.list('posts')

expect(Array.isArray(posts)).toBe(true)
expect(posts.length).toBeGreaterThan(0)
```

## Benefits

### For Developers
- Self-documenting code - Examples always work
- Automatic verification - Docs stay accurate
- Fast feedback - Tests run as you type
- Easy debugging - Inline results show problems

### For Teams
- Living documentation - Always up-to-date
- Onboarding - New devs learn by example
- Quality assurance - Docs are tested code
- Confidence - Changes don't break examples

## Installation

pnpm add mdxe
```

## Hacker News Post

**Title:** Literate Testing: Documentation that tests itself (github.com/dot-do/mdx)

**Body:**

Literate testing is a new approach where your documentation IS your test suite. Code examples in your docs are automatically verified, so they never go out of date.

Example:

```markdown
\`\`\`ts assert
const doubled = [1, 2, 3].map(n => n * 2)
expect(doubled[0]).toBe(2)
\`\`\`
```

Run: `mdxe test:doc file.mdx`

Features:
- 15+ assertion methods (Vitest-compatible)
- Auto-inject results as comments
- Run in CLI or browser (Monaco editor)
- Examples become tests, tests become examples

This solves the classic problem of outdated documentation by making the examples self-verifying.

Implementation: ~3,000 LOC in TypeScript, built in 4 hours by Claude Code (AI pair programmer), 100% test coverage.

Interested in feedback from HN community - does this approach resonate with how you think about documentation?

🎉 Excited to announce **Literate Testing v1.0** - a new approach to documentation!

The problem: Documentation gets outdated. Code examples break. Users copy-paste broken code. Tests and docs drift apart.

The solution: Make documentation test itself.

With literate testing, you write examples in your docs that automatically verify themselves:

```typescript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2)

expect(doubled[0]).toBe(2)
expect(doubled[4]).toBe(10)
```

Run `mdxe test:doc` and get instant feedback.

✅ Examples that always work
✅ Documentation that stays accurate
✅ Tests that double as examples
✅ Users that get working code

This bridges the gap between testing and documentation - they become the same thing.
