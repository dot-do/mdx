  The time needed to accelerate the vehicle from a given start velocity to a given target velocity.\n\nTypical unit code(s): SEC for seconds\n\n* Note: There are unfortunately no standard unit codes for seconds/0..100 km/h or seconds/0..60 mph. Simply use "SEC" for seconds and indicate the velocities in the [[name]] of the [[QuantitativeValue]], or use [[valueReference]] with a [[QuantitativeValue]] of 0..60 mph or 0..100 km/h to specify the reference speeds.
