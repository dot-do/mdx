# Building a JSX Framework for Slack Block Kit (Concept and Feasibility)

## Introduction

Developers often write Slack Block Kit layouts by manually constructing JSON payloads. A **React Ink**-like framework for Slack would let us instead define Slack UI surfaces (messages, modals, home tabs) using **JSX** components. This means describing Slack messages and modals in a declarative, component-based style, then rendering them to the JSON that Slack‚Äôs API expects. The goal is to improve developer experience by making Slack UI code more readable and maintainable (similar to how React components abstract DOM manipulation). In such a framework, developers could compose Slack layouts with JSX tags (e.g. `<Section>`, `<Actions>`, `<Button>`), and handle user interactions (button clicks, form submissions, etc.) with event handlers on the server side. Crucially, it should support **all Slack Block Kit surfaces and interactive elements** ‚Äì from message attachments to modals and home tabs ‚Äì and integrate with Slack‚Äôs Events API for interactivity. Below we explore existing tools, feasibility of implementing JSX-to-BlockKit conversion, handling interactivity in a Next.js (Node.js) environment, and best practices for state and event routing.

## Existing JSX-style Tools for Slack Block Kit

Before reinventing the wheel, it‚Äôs important to see if such a framework already exists. In fact, there **are libraries that bring JSX to Slack Block Kit**:

- **jsx-slack (Yuki Hattori)** ‚Äì An established library that allows developers to ‚Äúbuild JSON object for Slack Block Kit surfaces from JSX‚Äù. It provides a set of JSX components corresponding to Slack Block Kit blocks and elements. For example, developers can write Slack messages like a React component tree, and jsx-slack will output the equivalent JSON structure. It supports messages (wrapped in a `<Blocks>` container), modals (`<Modal>`), and home tabs (`<Home>`), as well as all standard Block Kit elements (sections, dividers, images, buttons, inputs, selects, etc.) and interactive components. The library even lets you use **HTML-like JSX for text formatting**, converting elements like `<b>Bold</b>` or `<i>Italic</i>` into Slack‚Äôs markdown under the hood. For instance, one can define a message as:

  ```jsx
  <Blocks>
    <Section>
      Hello, <b>{userName}</b>!
    </Section>
    <Actions>
      <Button actionId='say_hello'>Wave Hello üëã</Button>
    </Actions>
  </Blocks>
  ```

  This JSX would compile into a JSON payload with a section block (containing formatted text) and an actions block with a button. Using jsx-slack, the developer avoids hand-writing JSON and can instead compose UI in a familiar JSX syntax. The library‚Äôs documentation shows that **messages, modals, and home tabs can all be created through JSX components**, including interactive inputs and buttons. By passing the resulting JSON to Slack‚Äôs API (e.g. `chat.postMessage` or `views.open`), the JSX-defined interface is rendered in Slack. In short, _jsx-slack demonstrates that a JSX abstraction for Slack Block Kit is not only possible but mature_, covering essentially all Block Kit features (the project advertises support for ‚Äúall current Slack Block Kit objects‚Äù).

- **Slack Block Builder** ‚Äì While not JSX-based, this is a popular library that offers a _declarative, chainable_ syntax for building Slack UIs in code. It was inspired by SwiftUI and allows constructing messages via a fluent API (e.g. `Blocks().section(...).actions(...).build()`). Block Builder emphasizes maintainable and testable Slack UI code. It supports interactive components, modals, and home tabs as well. We mention it because it shows the demand for higher-level abstractions over raw Slack JSON. However, our focus is JSX; a JSX-based framework would aim for similar benefits (readability, reuse, static typing) but with a React-like component syntax instead of a chained builder.

Aside from these, there are also tools like **Slack‚Äôs Block Kit Builder** (a web UI to visually assemble block JSON) and community projects that render Slack blocks in React for web previews (e.g. Slack-block-to-JSX previewers). Those are useful for designing or visualizing blocks but do not provide a JSX coding framework to define Slack app interfaces. To our knowledge, **jsx-slack is the primary library that directly offers a JSX abstraction for Slack Block Kit**. It can serve as a reference for what a ‚ÄúReact Ink for Slack‚Äù might look like in practice.

## Transforming JSX into Slack JSON (Building from Scratch)

If one were to build such a framework from scratch, the core challenge is **converting JSX markup into Slack‚Äôs Block Kit JSON structure**. Fortunately, JSX is just syntax that can be transformed ‚Äì either at compile time (with Babel/TypeScript) or at runtime ‚Äì into JavaScript objects. Here‚Äôs how a Slack-UI JSX framework could work:

- **Custom JSX Elements**: Each Slack Block Kit component (blocks, block elements, etc.) would be represented by a JSX component. For example, you might have `<Section>`, `<Divider>`, `<Image>`, `<Actions>`, `<Button>`, `<Input>`, and so on. Under the hood, these aren‚Äôt real DOM elements but factory functions that produce JSON objects matching Slack‚Äôs schema. For instance, a `<Section>` component‚Äôs implementation could take `props.children` and return a JSON object:

  ```js
  function Section({ children, ...props }) {
    return {
      type: 'section',
      text: { type: 'mrkdwn', text: renderText(children) },
      ...props, // e.g. block_id, etc.
    }
  }
  ```

  Here, `renderText(children)` would be a helper that converts the JSX children (which might include strings or `<b>`, `<i>` tags for bold/italic) into a plaintext or Mrkdwn-formatted string that Slack expects. This is analogous to how React would render children to an HTML string, but in our case it generates Slack markdown. The framework can define lightweight **intrinsic elements** like `<b>`, `<i>`, `<br>` to make text formatting intuitive ‚Äì indeed, **jsx-slack uses HTML-like tags in JSX and converts them to Slack formatting internally**.

- **Container Components for Surfaces**: Slack messages and views require specific JSON structure (e.g. a message payload is an object with a `"blocks"` array, a modal view is an object with `"type": "modal"`, `"title"`, `"blocks"`, etc.). The framework could provide high-level containers like `<Blocks>` (for message or basic surfaces), `<Modal>` (for modals), and `<Home>` (for app home tabs). These components would wrap the block elements and output the appropriately wrapped JSON. For example, a `<Blocks>` component might simply collect its children (which should be an array of block objects) and return them as an array (ready to assign to `blocks` in a chat.postMessage call). A `<Modal>` component would produce a JSON view definition including `type: "modal"`, the provided `title`, `close`/`submit` labels, and an array of blocks from its children. This mirrors Slack‚Äôs structure: for instance, `jsx-slack`‚Äôs `<Modal>` JSX corresponds to the JSON required by `views.open` for modals. By implementing these, developers can declaratively construct any Slack surface.

- **JSX to JSON Compilation**: There are a couple of approaches to turn the JSX syntax into actual objects:

  1. **Compile-time (Babel/TSX)**: Configure a custom JSX pragma or runtime. For example, jsx-slack uses a custom JSX factory (`/** @jsxImportSource jsx-slack */`) so that JSX elements are converted into calls to its own createElement function. By doing this, `<Section>Hello</Section>` invokes a function that creates the `{type: "section", ...}` object. Writing a Babel plugin or using React‚Äôs `createElement` override is feasible ‚Äì you essentially parse the JSX AST and produce JSON instead of DOM elements. This is similar to how React Native or Ink have a custom renderer.
  2. **Runtime (Tagged Template or Hyper-script)**: Another route is to use a tagged template literal that parses JSX-like syntax at runtime. The **jsx-slack** library offers a tagged template called `jsxslack` which leverages **HTM (Hyperscript Markup)** to interpret a template string as JSX. For example:

     ```js
     jsxslack`<Blocks><Section>Hello, <b>${name}</b>!</Section></Blocks>`
     ```

     would return the JSON structure directly, without needing a transpiler. This is convenient for quick use cases or environments where setting up Babel isn‚Äôt desired. Alternatively, one could use a virtual DOM library or hyperscript approach (e.g. create elements via `h(type, props, ...children)` calls) to build the JSON tree.

  In either case, building the converter is **feasible**. Slack‚Äôs JSON structure is not deeply nested like a DOM; it‚Äôs essentially a hierarchy of blocks and elements with known types. The transformation can be relatively straightforward mapping from JSX tag -> Slack JSON:

  - Unknown JSX tags or raw text children get handled by text rendering (converted to Slack markdown or plaintext as needed).
  - Component props correspond to Slack JSON fields (e.g. `<Button actionId="foo" style="primary">` becomes `{ type: "button", text: {...}, action_id: "foo", style: "primary" }`).
  - Children of components are placed appropriately (for instance, children of `<Actions>` should be interactive elements like `<Button>` and will form an array in the "elements" field of the actions block).
  - The framework must enforce Slack‚Äôs rules (e.g. an `<Image>` inside a `<Section>` becomes an accessory image, a `<Field>` inside a `<Section>` populates the section‚Äôs fields array, etc.). This can be done either via runtime checks or TypeScript types to guide proper nesting.

- **Example ‚Äì Defining a Slack Component**: To illustrate, imagine defining a simple `<Header>` component for Slack‚Äôs header block:

  ```jsx
  const Header = ({ children }) => ({
    type: 'header',
    text: { type: 'plain_text', text: children.toString(), emoji: true },
  })
  ```

  This function takes `children` (expecting plain text in this case) and returns the JSON for a Slack header block. A developer could then use `<Header>Welcome</Header>` in JSX, and it would output `{ type: "header", text: { "type": "plain_text", "text": "Welcome", "emoji": true }}`. Similar component definitions would be made for sections, contexts, dividers, images, etc., possibly grouping them into modules for layout blocks, block elements, and composition objects.

Overall, building the JSX-to-JSON layer is quite **doable** ‚Äì as evidenced by jsx-slack and similar implementations. The heavy lifting is mostly in mapping the entirety of Slack‚Äôs Block Kit spec to JSX components (to meet the goal of supporting _all_ UI features). This means implementing dozens of components (for every block type, interactive element, and input type), handling their props, and ensuring the output JSON validates against Slack‚Äôs expectations. With a solid test suite (verifying that each JSX component produces correct JSON), one can achieve a comprehensive framework. The benefit is a much more intuitive syntax for developers. They can read and write Slack UIs as JSX markup, which feels more self-documenting than constructing JSON by hand.

It‚Äôs worth noting that this JSX representation is used on the **server side** ‚Äì there is no client-side rendering here. The JSX is rendered to JSON on the server (for example, in a Next.js API route or getServerSideProps), and then that JSON is sent to Slack via web API. There is no ‚ÄúSlack DOM‚Äù to manage in a browser; instead, the Slack app (running on Node) just generates and sends the UI definitions. This simplifies things: we don‚Äôt need a diffing algorithm or a persistent rendering loop like React DOM. Each time the UI needs to update (e.g. send a new message or update a view), we can call our JSX render function again to get new JSON and then call Slack‚Äôs API to update the message or modal.

## Handling Interactivity in a Next.js Server Environment

Defining the UI in JSX is only half of the story ‚Äì Slack apps are interactive, meaning the app needs to respond to user inputs (button clicks, menu selections, form submissions, etc.). Slack‚Äôs model for interactivity is event-driven: when a user interacts with a Block Kit element, Slack sends an HTTP POST payload to your app (to a URL you configure in your app‚Äôs settings). This is part of Slack‚Äôs **Events API and Interactivity** mechanism. In a Next.js (Node.js) environment, here‚Äôs how we can manage these interactions:

- **Slack Event Endpoint**: We need to set up an endpoint for Slack to hit. In Next.js, one approach is to create an API route (for example, `/api/slack/events`) that is configured as the Request URL for interactions (and potentially events). Slack will send different payloads for different interaction types ‚Äì e.g., a `block_actions` payload when a user clicks an interactive component in a message, or a `view_submission` payload when a modal form is submitted. The server (Next.js) must parse the incoming request, verify its signature (to ensure it‚Äôs from Slack), and then route it to the appropriate handler.

- **Using Slack Bolt (Framework)**: An effective way to manage this in Node/Next is to use Slack‚Äôs official Bolt framework. **Bolt for JavaScript** provides a convenient API to listen for actions and events with handlers, abstracting the low-level details of the HTTP server. For example, in a Bolt app you might write:

  ```js
  app.action('say_hello', async ({ ack, body, client }) => {
    await ack() // acknowledge the button click immediately
    const user = body.user.id
    // Respond to interaction (e.g., send a message or open a modal)
    await client.chat.postMessage({
      channel: body.channel.id,
      text: `Hello, <@${user}>! üëã`,
    })
  })
  ```

  This snippet registers a handler for any button or element with `action_id: "say_hello"`. When our JSX-defined `<Button actionId="say_hello">Wave Hello</Button>` is clicked in Slack, Slack sends a `block_actions` payload, Bolt matches the `action_id` and invokes the handler. We call `ack()` to immediately acknowledge the action (preventing Slack from timing out) and then use Slack‚Äôs Web API (`client`) to post a follow-up message (here we send a greeting back to the channel).

  Integrating Bolt with Next.js requires a bit of glue code, because Next‚Äôs API routes are serverless (stateless) and Bolt‚Äôs default receivers expect a long-running Express server. A known solution is to use a **custom Bolt receiver that works with Next.js**. For instance, a `NextConnectReceiver` can adapt Next‚Äôs request/response objects to Bolt‚Äôs interface using the `next-connect` middleware library. This technique has been demonstrated in the community: it allows you to mount your Bolt app within a Next.js API route (including on Vercel). With such a setup, you can enjoy all of Bolt‚Äôs features (like `app.action`, `app.view` for modals, etc.) inside your Next app. Essentially, Next‚Äôs API route catches all Slack requests and hands them off to the Bolt app for processing, and Bolt ensures proper responses.

- **Manual Handling (without Bolt)**: It‚Äôs also possible to handle interactions manually. Your Next.js API route would need to:

  1. Read and parse the `payload` (Slack sends it as a form-encoded string containing JSON).
  2. Verify the Slack signature (using the signing secret, to ensure security).
  3. Determine the type of event (e.g. `payload.type === 'block_actions'` or `'view_submission'`).
  4. Route to the correct logic based on identifiers. For example, you might switch on the `action_id` for block actions, or on `callback_id` for view submissions.
  5. Respond with status 200 quickly (Slack requires an _acknowledgment response within 3 seconds_), possibly with an empty body if no immediate response is needed.
  6. Perform any further actions (like calling Slack Web API to update a message or open a new modal).

  While this approach gives fine-grained control, it involves more boilerplate. Bolt essentially does these steps under the hood and provides a nicer API. Either way, the Next.js server (or serverless function) will be the one orchestrating the interaction logic.

- **Working in Next.js Constraints**: If deploying on Vercel or another serverless platform, remember that each function invocation is short-lived. After sending a response, you cannot keep in-memory state (the process may freeze or terminate). Therefore, _immediate acknowledgment is critical_ ‚Äì Slack‚Äôs request will timeout if not answered in 3 seconds ‚Äì and any longer processing should be done asynchronously (or via an external queue). The Bolt framework accommodates this with `processBeforeResponse` for FaaS (Functions-as-a-Service) environments, ensuring event handlers run _before_ the HTTP response is sent. In practice, this means you should design your interactive handlers to be quick or offload heavy tasks, and use the provided `response_url` or other asynchronous methods to send later updates if needed.

- **Updating Slack UI**: Once an interaction is handled, the app might need to update the Slack UI. For example, if a user clicks a button to open a modal, the handler would call `client.views.open({ trigger_id, view: <Modal JSX converted to JSON> })`. If a user submits a form, the handler might call `client.chat.update({ ts, channel, blocks: <Blocks JSX to JSON> })` to update a message. In our JSX framework, we would reuse the JSX components to generate the new UI states. The cycle is: **user action -> server handler -> (optionally) re-render JSX to JSON -> Slack API call to update UI**. This is analogous to a React re-render on state change, except ‚Äúapplying‚Äù the changes means sending a new message or view to Slack. Because Slack doesn‚Äôt maintain an open connection for UI (it just displays whatever was last sent), updates are explicit API calls.

## State Management and Routing Interactions to Components

Building interactive Slack apps in a React-like way requires careful thinking about **state** and **event routing**. In a web React app, components hold state and event handlers directly. In a Slack app, the ‚Äústate‚Äù might live on the server (or database), and events are delivered via HTTP requests. Here are best practices and approaches:

- **Identifying Interactions (Action IDs and Callback IDs)**: Every interactive Block Kit element should have an `action_id` (for buttons, selects, date pickers, etc.), and modals have a `callback_id`. These IDs are the linchpin for routing events. In a framework, you might allow developers to pass an `actionId` prop or similar to components, or even auto-generate unique IDs. Slack will include this ID in the interaction payload when that element is triggered. Best practice is to use **descriptive, unique action IDs** for each interactive element so you can tell in the handler what was clicked. For example, a delete button for item 123 could have `action_id: "delete_123"` or include context in the `value` property. In our JSX framework, we could even hide this by allowing an `onClick` prop: e.g. `<Button onClick={() => handleDelete(itemId)}>` ‚Äì the framework could generate a GUID for action_id and internally map it to the provided handler. This is how some higher-level libraries might do it (storing a registry of handlers). However, in a stateless serverless scenario, storing a handler in memory between requests is tricky. A simpler pattern is to require the developer to handle actions by ID (just as Bolt does) or to externalize state.

- **State Management**: Slack interactions are by default stateless ‚Äì each request from Slack contains the info needed (user, channel, message, etc., and in modals, the form inputs). If your app needs to maintain multi-step state or user-specific data between interactions, you have a few options:

  - **Use Slack‚Äôs built-in state features**: For modals, Slack provides a `private_metadata` field where you can store an opaque string (e.g., JSON) when opening the modal. This metadata will be returned to you upon submission. You can use it to keep track of what the modal is related to (for example, an ID of a record the modal is editing, or the step the user is on). Also, interactive components in modals can have an `initial_value` or you can use `view.state.values` to retrieve all inputs on submission.
  - **Encode state in action payloads**: For simple cases, you can encode information in the `action_id` or `value` of a button. For instance, `<Button actionId={`delete\_\${item.id}`} value={item.id}>Delete</Button>` will cause the payload to carry that `value` (the item id) when clicked. The handler can parse the action_id or value to know which item to delete.
  - **Server-side storage**: For more complex state (like a long conversation or form wizard), you might store data in a server-side cache or database keyed by user or channel. For example, when a user starts a multi-step interaction, you save a record of their progress. Each interaction payload includes the user ID and possibly a `view.id` or message `ts` (timestamp) that can key into that state. This way, when an event comes in, you look up what the user was doing and then decide how to respond. This is analogous to maintaining a session.

- **Routing Events to Component Logic**: If we want a truly React-like developer experience, we‚Äôd like to write something like `<Button onClick={handleClick}>` and have `handleClick` be invoked when the button is pressed. Achieving this requires the framework to map Slack‚Äôs event back to the original component or handler. There are a couple of patterns:

  - **Central Dispatcher**: The framework can maintain a mapping of action IDs to callbacks. For example, when rendering a `<Button onClick={fn}>`, it generates a unique action_id (if not provided) and stores the `fn` in a global (or persistent) registry. Then the central Slack event handler (the dispatcher) simply looks up `registry[payload.action_id]` and calls the corresponding function. This is similar to how frontend frameworks wire event listeners. The challenge is scope and lifetime: if your Next.js environment is serverless, a new instance of the code may handle the event and might not have the old registry in memory. This can be mitigated by using a persistent store for the registry (not ideal), or by designing the app to run in a single process (e.g., a long-running Node server or using Next.js in Node mode, not purely serverless).
  - **Bolt-style registration**: Alternatively, require the developer to register handlers (which is essentially what Bolt does). For example, you define all your interactive behavior upfront: `app.action('say_hello', handleHello)` etc. This is less magic but more explicit. It works reliably in stateless environments because your code can re-register the handlers on each cold start. The handlers then operate based on the IDs. This approach pairs well with using meaningful action IDs in the JSX. In practice, a framework could still generate action IDs automatically but print them or allow binding via some identifier.

- **Component Encapsulation**: In a larger app, you might have multiple interactive components and want to modularize their logic. One best practice is to **namespace your action IDs or callback IDs** per UI component. For instance, if you have a `<TaskItem>` component that renders a task with ‚ÄúComplete‚Äù and ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù buttons, you could have it generate action IDs like `task_complete_<taskId>` and `task_delete_<taskId>`. The component could even expose a prop for a prefix to avoid collisions. Then in your handlers, you can pattern-match on those IDs. This manual namespacing is somewhat analogous to giving unique `key` props in React lists ‚Äì it ensures one handler doesn‚Äôt accidentally catch another‚Äôs event. Using block IDs (the `block_id` field in Slack blocks) is another way to scope interactions; Slack will include block_id in the payload, so you could determine which part of a message the action came from. For example, if two different components both have a `done` button, giving their surrounding blocks distinct `block_id` values lets you differentiate in one handler.

- **Routing to Update the Right UI**: When an interaction requires updating the Slack UI, you need to know **what to update**. Slack provides context like a `response_url` (to post a message reply) or a `container` (with message timestamp and channel) or a `view.id` (for modals) in the payload. Your handler should use that to target the correct message or modal. For example, a button in a message might come with a `channel` and message `ts`; you‚Äôd call `chat.update` on that ts to modify the message. A modal submission gives you `view.id` and a `hash`; you‚Äôd call `views.update` or `views.push` if you want to update or stack another modal. In a component-centric view, you might design your components to know how to update themselves (perhaps by storing identifiers in the `private_metadata`). But typically, the server code simply generates a new JSX view and calls the appropriate API method with the relevant ID.

**Best Practices Summary**: Use Slack identifiers to route events to the correct handler. Acknowledge events quickly to keep Slack happy. Manage state either through Slack‚Äôs provided fields (values, private metadata) or external storage if necessary. Keep interactive workflows straightforward ‚Äì Slack UIs are transient, so design interactions as short-lived transactions when possible. If building a framework, hide as much boilerplate as you can: for example, the framework might automatically wire `onSubmit` on a `<Modal>` to a handler that receives the form values, so the developer can simply define a function to handle the result of that modal. Under the hood, that could use the modal‚Äôs callback_id to route the submission.

## Example: Putting It All Together

To solidify these concepts, imagine a simple Slack app built with a JSX Block Kit framework on Next.js. We‚Äôll outline how it might look:

- **Defining the UI in JSX**: Suppose we have a component that renders a message with a button to say hello, and a modal that gets triggered by that button:

  ```jsx
  // SlackMessage.jsx
  import { Blocks, Section, Actions, Button, Modal, Input } from 'my-slack-jsx-lib'

  export const GreetingMessage = ({ userName }) => (
    <Blocks>
      <Section>
        Hello, <b>{userName}</b>! Want to say hello back?
      </Section>
      <Actions>
        <Button actionId='open_hello_modal' style='primary'>
          Say Hello
        </Button>
      </Actions>
    </Blocks>
  )

  export const HelloModal = ({ recipient }) => (
    <Modal title='Send a greeting' submit='Send' close='Cancel' callbackId='hello_modal'>
      <Input name='message' label={`Send a hello to ${recipient}:`} required />
    </Modal>
  )
  ```

  In this code, `<GreetingMessage>` defines a message with a primary button. The button‚Äôs `actionId` is set to `"open_hello_modal"`, which means when clicked, Slack will send an action payload with that ID. The `<HelloModal>` defines a modal view (with a callbackId of `"hello_modal"`) containing a text input. We‚Äôll use this modal to let the user type a custom hello message.

- **Rendering and Sending the Message**: In a Next.js API route (or as part of responding to an event like an app home opened), you would render the JSX to JSON and call Slack API:

  ```js
  import { GreetingMessage } from './SlackMessage'
  import { WebClient } from '@slack/web-api'

  const web = new WebClient(process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN)
  const blocks = JSXSlack(<GreetingMessage userName='Alice' />)
  await web.chat.postMessage({ channel: channelId, blocks })
  ```

  This sends the initial message to Slack. (If using Bolt, you might do this in response to an event, e.g. `app.message('hi', ({say}) => say({ blocks: GreetingMessage({ userName: 'Alice' }) }))` ‚Äì Bolt can accept a pre-built blocks array.)

- **Handling the Button Interaction**: Next, we set up a handler for the `"open_hello_modal"` action. In a Bolt app within Next.js, it could be:

  ```js
  app.action('open_hello_modal', async ({ ack, body, client }) => {
    await ack()
    // Open the modal when the button is clicked
    const triggerId = body.trigger_id
    const user = body.user.name
    const modalView = JSXSlack(<HelloModal recipient={user} />)
    await client.views.open({ trigger_id: triggerId, view: modalView })
  })
  ```

  Here we acknowledge the button click, then use `views.open` to show our `HelloModal`. We pass in the user‚Äôs name as `recipient` prop just to personalize the label inside the modal. Notice that we needed the `trigger_id` from the action payload ‚Äì Slack provides this for opening modals in response to an interaction. The JSX modal is converted to JSON (`modalView`), which Bolt sends to Slack.

- **Handling Modal Submission**: When the user submits the modal, Slack will send a `view_submission` payload with our callback_id `"hello_modal"`. We register a handler for that:

  ```js
  app.view('hello_modal', async ({ ack, body, client }) => {
    await ack()
    const vals = body.view.state.values
    const messageInput = vals['message']['message'].value // each block is keyed by block_id, each input by action_id; assume we let Slack default those keys here for simplicity
    const user = body.user.id
    // For simplicity, just respond in chat to confirm the greeting
    await client.chat.postMessage({
      channel: user,
      text: `You said: "${messageInput}" to ${body.view.private_metadata || 'your friend'}`,
    })
  })
  ```

  We acknowledge the modal submission, then retrieve the input value from the view state. (In Slack modals, all input blocks are identified in `view.state.values` by their block and action IDs). We then use `chat.postMessage` to send a confirmation to the user (in a real app, maybe we‚Äôd DM the target user or perform some action with the input). Note that if we needed context from before opening the modal, we could have put it in `private_metadata` when opening the modal (e.g., who the recipient was), and it would be available in `body.view.private_metadata` on submission.

This end-to-end example shows how a JSX-defined Slack UI ties into interactive handlers. The **framework** (like jsx-slack) makes it easy to define the UI, and Slack‚Äôs event system combined with a Next.js/Bolt backend handles the interaction. The developer gets to work with higher-level constructs (JSX components and event callbacks) rather than raw JSON and manual HTTP handling, which speeds up development and reduces errors.

## Conclusion

Creating a React Ink-like framework for Slack Block Kit using JSX is not only feasible, but tools like **jsx-slack** have already paved the way with JSX abstractions for Slack UI. By mapping Slack‚Äôs JSON structure to a component hierarchy, developers can declaratively construct messages, modals, and home tabs in JSX ‚Äì improving readability and reusability of Slack UI code. All Slack surfaces (messages, modals, home tabs) and interactive elements (buttons, selects, date pickers, inputs, etc.) can be supported in this paradigm. The main work in building such a framework from scratch lies in implementing the JSX-to-JSON transformation for each Block Kit component and handling nested text formatting.

On the server side, integrating with Slack‚Äôs interactivity model is key. Using Slack‚Äôs Events API in a Next.js environment typically involves setting up an API route to receive events and interactive payloads, and using a framework like Bolt (or a custom router) to dispatch actions to the right handlers. Following Slack‚Äôs best practices ‚Äì like acknowledging events quickly (within 3 seconds) ‚Äì ensures a smooth user experience. **State management** in Slack apps often relies on short-term context (action IDs, modal private metadata, etc.) rather than long-lived component instances, but with careful design you can manage multi-step workflows by storing context in Slack payloads or external storage.

In summary, a JSX-based Slack UI framework would allow developers to:

- **Define** Slack app interfaces in a familiar JSX/React style, using components for blocks and elements instead of writing JSON.
- **Support** all Slack UI features declaratively, from text formatting to interactive form elements, and render them to the exact JSON Slack expects.
- **Handle** user interactions by mapping Slack‚Äôs callbacks (action_ids, etc.) to server-side logic, ideally in a structured way that feels like handling React component events.
- **Run** on a server platform like Next.js, taking advantage of serverless functions or Node servers to listen for Slack events and respond via Slack‚Äôs Web API. With tools like Bolt and Next.js middleware, this integration can be done in a maintainable, scalable fashion.

By following the patterns above and learning from existing libraries, one can build a robust framework ‚Äúlike React Ink for Slack‚Äù ‚Äì bringing the power of JSX and component-based development to Slack app UIs. This approach significantly improves the developer experience for Slack apps and makes complex interactive messages easier to implement and reason about.
